# CI/CD Integration with SonarCloud – Java Lab

## Lab Context

### Lab: CI/CD Integration with SonarCloud

This repository contains a **simple Java Maven project** with **intentional code quality issues**.  
It is used to demonstrate how **static code analysis** and **quality gates** work in a **CI/CD pipeline** using **SonarCloud** and **GitHub Actions**.

The goal of this lab is to help students understand:
- Why code quality matters
- How CI/CD pipelines react to code changes
- How SonarCloud identifies bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells


---

## What Students Must Do

> ⚠️ **Do not change the project structure before starting the lab.**  
> Follow the lab sheet instructions for detailed steps.

### Student Tasks

1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account
2. Connect your forked repository to **SonarCloud**
3. Add a **GitHub Actions** workflow for CI analysis
4. Observe **Quality Gate** results in SonarCloud
5. Fix reported issues and re-run the pipeline

## Technical Requirements

### Requirements

- Java 17
- Maven
- GitHub account
- SonarCloud account

---


## Expected Outcome

By completing this lab, students will be able to:
- Integrate a GitHub repository with SonarCloud
- Run static code analysis as part of a CI pipeline
- Understand Quality Gates and their impact on CI/CD
- Improve code quality based on SonarCloud feedback

---

## Notes

- This project is **intentionally imperfect**.
- Quality issues are expected and required for the lab.
- Do **not** aim for a green Quality Gate in the first run.
